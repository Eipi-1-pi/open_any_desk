# Open AnyDesk

This tool ensures that AnyDesk is always running on your computer. If AnyDesk is closed or not started, the tool will automatically open it for you.

## Installation

To install the service, run the following command:

```bash
python monitor.py install
```

## Usage

To start the service, use the following command:

```bash
python monitor.py start
```

To stop the service, use:

```bash
python monitor.py stop
```

To remove the service, use:

```bash
python monitor.py remove
```

## Features

- Automatically checks if AnyDesk is running.
- Starts AnyDesk if it has been closed.
- Prevents shutdown if critical services are running.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `ctypes`, `win32serviceutil`, `win32service`, `win32event`, `servicemanager`, `psutil`, `time`, `subprocess`, `os`

## How it Works

The script runs as a Windows service that monitors the status of AnyDesk. If AnyDesk is not running, it will start the application automatically.

## File Structure

- `monitor.py`: The main script to install, start, stop, and remove the service.
